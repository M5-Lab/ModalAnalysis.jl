"""
Assumes positions given in the system are the reference positions to calculate displacements from. 

Generates output that is compatible with `NMA`` or `INMA`.

Currently no parallelization within a simulation, run as many seeds as cores available. Each seed
creates 0.5 GB of position storage plus other storage. Ensure you have ~ 1GB of RAM per seed plus
enough to store the second and third order force constants in RAM.
